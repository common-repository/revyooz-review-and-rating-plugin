A review/rating plugin allowing you to give a product/service/etc a rating out of 5 stars. You can choose the names of the features that you are rating.

== Description ==

If you've ever wanted to offer a rating out of 5 stars for a product or service or website or movie or really whatever you're blogging about, then this is the plugin for you. I went looking for something that would do exactly what I wanted, but couldn't find it — and I didn't want a new theme that incorporated rating functionality.

You decide which features to rate on a site-wide basis. For example, a movie rating site might want to include features like: plot, characters, quality etc. Where an app reviewer may want to have features like: price, playalbility, value etc. I have plans for a future version that would allow changing the features on a per-post bvasis.

Please let me know if you have any problems with the plugin or have any suggestions for future updates.
